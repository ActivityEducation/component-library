# **AscendUCore Design System & Component Library**

> Please feel free to also check out our [Primary Documentation Site](https://join.edupub.social).

## **Introduction & Overview**

The **AscendUCore Design System** is the foundational visual and interactive language powering our educational platform built on ActivityPub. Its core intent is to create a consistent, professional, and confidence-inspiring user experience across all applications. By providing reusable components, clear guidelines, and robust design tokens, we streamline development and elevate the entire learning journey.

### **Purpose and Benefits**

The driving force behind the AscendUCore Design System is a commitment to accelerate development, ensure brand cohesion, and significantly enhance the user experience for self-paced learners.

- **Unwavering Consistency:** We guarantee a unified look, feel, and behavior across every aspect of the platform. This predictability in UI fosters trust and ease of use, critical for learners who depend on a stable and predictable environment.
- **Accelerated Efficiency:** By offering a library of pre-built, rigorously tested, and well-documented UI components, we drastically cut down development cycles. Teams can rapidly assemble interfaces, focusing on innovation rather than rebuilding common elements.
- **Seamless Scalability:** As our platform and team expand, the design system ensures new developers and designers can quickly contribute. A shared language and toolkit prevent "design drift," ensuring all new features integrate seamlessly.
- **Effortless Maintainability:** Centralizing all design decisions and component logic simplifies ongoing maintenance. Updates, bug fixes, and enhancements to UI elements are applied once and propagated across all consuming applications, reducing long-term effort and technical debt.
- **Inherent Accessibility:** Accessibility (WCAG standards) is a foundational principle, not an afterthought. Components are built from the ground up to be inclusive, ensuring an equitable learning environment for individuals of all abilities.
- **Strengthened Brand Identity:** Consistent application of visual guidelines and interactive patterns reinforces the AscendUCore brand. Every user interaction contributes to a cohesive, recognizable, and reliable brand presence.

### **Core Principles & Design Philosophy**

Our design philosophy is deeply rooted in the unique needs of an educational context, with every decision prioritizing the learner's journey and experience.

- **Clarity & Readability:** Information is presented with absolute clarity. Typography, color contrast, and layout are optimized to minimize cognitive load, allowing learners to focus purely on absorbing knowledge.
- **Approachability & Trust:** We design for an inviting, intuitive, and reassuring interface. A clean aesthetic and predictable interactions build user confidence in both the platform and its content.
- **Focus & Minimal Distraction:** Recognizing the importance of concentration for self-paced learners, our UI guides attention to essential content. Unnecessary clutter and distractions are minimized, encouraging deep engagement with learning materials.
- **Progress & Achievement:** The system subtly, yet effectively, communicates progress and celebrates milestones. Visual indicators, encouraging feedback, and clear pathways motivate learners, reinforcing their accomplishments throughout their educational journey.
- **Adaptive Responsiveness:** Components are engineered to adapt seamlessly across all devices ‚Äì desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. This ensures an optimal and uncompromised learning experience, regardless of the screen size.

## **üöÄ Features**

- **Slider**: Interactive control for selecting a value from a range with a draggable thumb, configurable min/max/step values, and disabled state.
- **Spinner**: Animated circular loading indicator for indeterminate loading states, available in various sizes (sm, md, lg).
- **Table**: Structured component for tabular data display with default styling for headers and rows, responsive overflow handling, and optional striped rows/bordered cells.
- **TabGroup / Tab**: Components to organize content into distinct, switchable sections, managing active states and providing navigation between views.
- **Toolbar**: Flexible containers for grouping actions or navigation, with alignment options and support for item wrapping/grouping.
- **WYSIWYGEditor**: A rich text editor with a contentEditable area and a robust toolbar for basic formatting, links, lists, and blockquotes.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used**

The AscendUCore Component Library is built upon a modern and efficient technology stack chosen for its performance, developer experience, and compatibility within the React ecosystem:

- **React**: The core JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Emotion.js (`@emotion/react`, `@emotion/styled`)**: Our chosen CSS-in-JS library for dynamic, scoped, and theme-driven styling.
- **TypeScript**: Used universally for static type-checking, improving code quality and developer experience.
- **Storybook**: The primary development environment and documentation portal for isolated component development, testing, and showcasing.
- **Font Awesome (`@fortawesome/react-fontawesome`)**: Integrated for scalable vector icons and consistent iconography.
- **Vite**: A next-generation frontend tooling providing an extremely fast development server and efficient bundling.
- **Rollup**: Used for generating lean, efficient CommonJS (CJS) and ES Module (ESM) production bundles, including TypeScript declaration files (.d.ts).
- **Semantic-Release**: Automates the package release workflow, including versioning, changelog generation, publishing to npm, and GitHub releases/tags.
- **Vitest**: Our chosen testing framework for fast and modern unit and component testing, integrating seamlessly with Vite.
- **ESLint**: Static code analysis tool configured to enforce code quality standards and style consistency.

## **üì¶ Installation**

To set up the AscendUCore Design System locally for development or to explore its components, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-repo/ascenducore-ui-kit.git](https://github.com/your-repo/ascenducore-ui-kit.git)
    cd ascenducore-ui-kit
    ```

    _(Replace `https://github.com/your-repo/ascenducore-ui-kit.git` with your actual repository URL)_

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Add Font Awesome CSS for Storybook (Crucial for Icon Component):**
    To ensure that Font Awesome icons render correctly within the Storybook environment, their global CSS stylesheet must be loaded. This is handled automatically by Storybook due to configurations in `main.ts` and the inclusion of the Font Awesome CDN link within `preview-head.html`. This ensures that when you run the Storybook development server, the icons are correctly displayed.
    You can manually verify or add the following line to `.storybook/preview-head.html`:
    ```html
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="[https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0/css/all.min.css](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0/css/all.min.css)"
      integrity="sha512-9usAa10IRO0HhonpyAIVpjrylPvoDwiPUiKdWk5t3PyolY1cOd4DSE0Ga+ri4AuTroPR5aQvXU9xC6qOPnzFeg=="
      crossorigin="anonymous"
      referrerpolicy="no-referrer"
    />
    ```

## **üí° Usage in Your Project**

The AscendUCore Component Library is designed to be consumed as a standard npm package within any React application. It can also be integrated into traditional CSS/Sass projects via CSS variables.

### **Package Information**

The library is published as an npm package named `@activityeducation/component-library`.

### **Peer Dependencies**

The library relies on `react` and `react-dom` as "peer dependencies" (versions compatible with `^19.0.0`). This ensures the consuming application provides compatible React instances, preventing issues with duplicate React versions.

### **ThemeProvider Setup (Crucial!)**

All AscendUCore components, styled with Emotion.js, require a `ThemeProvider` to access global design tokens. It is crucial to wrap your application, or the sections utilizing these components, with this `ThemeProvider`.

**Example for React applications (`App.js` or `_app.js`):**

```typescript
import React from "react";
import { ThemeProvider, theme, Button } from "ascenducore-ui-kit"; // Adjust path if local linking

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <div>
        <h1>My Learning Platform</h1>
        <Button variant="primary">Start Course</Button>
        {/* Other components from AscendUCore UI Kit */}
      </div>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
export default App;
```
