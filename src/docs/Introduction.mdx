## **Installation**

To set up the AscendUCore Design System locally for development or to explore its components, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ascenducore-ui-kit.git  
   cd ascenducore-ui-kit

   *(Replace https://github.com/your-repo/ascenducore-ui-kit.git with your actual repository URL)*  
2. **Install dependencies:**  
   `npm install` or `yarn install`

3. Add Font Awesome CSS for Storybook (Crucial for Icon Component):  
   To ensure that Font Awesome icons render correctly within the Storybook environment, their global CSS stylesheet must be loaded. This is handled automatically by Storybook due to configurations in main.ts and the inclusion of the Font Awesome CDN link within preview-head.html. This ensures that when you run the Storybook development server, the icons are correctly displayed.  
   You can manually verify or add the following line to .storybook/preview-head.html:  
   ```html
   <!-- .storybook/preview-head.html -->  
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0/css/all.min.css" integrity="sha512-9usAa10IRO0HhonpyAIVpjrylPvoDwiPUiKdWk5t3PyolY1cOd4DSE0Ga+ri4AuTroPR5aQvXU9xC6qOPnzFeg==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" />
   ```

## **Usage in Your Project**

The AscendUCore Component Library is designed to be consumed as a standard npm package within any React application. It can also be integrated into traditional CSS/Sass projects via CSS variables.

### **Package Information**

The library is published as an npm package named @activityeducation/component-library. The current stable version is 1.0.5.

### **Peer Dependencies**

The library relies on react and react-dom as "peer dependencies" (versions compatible with ^19.0.0). This ensures the consuming application provides compatible React instances, preventing issues with duplicate React versions.

### **ThemeProvider Setup (Crucial\!)**

All AscendUCore components, styled with Emotion.js, require a ThemeProvider to access global design tokens. It is crucial to wrap your application, or the sections utilizing these components, with this ThemeProvider.  
**Example for React applications (App.js or \_app.js):**  
```tsx
import React from 'react';  
import { ThemeProvider, theme, Button } from 'ascenducore-ui-kit'; // Adjust path if local linking

function App() {  
  return (  
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>  
      <div>  
        <h1>My Learning Platform</h1>  
        <Button variant="primary">Start Course</Button>  
        {/\* Other components from AscendUCore UI Kit \*/}  
      </div>  
    </ThemeProvider>  
  );  
}  
export default App;
```

### **Importing and Using Components**

Components are imported directly from the published npm package using standard ES6 import syntax and used as standard React components within your JSX code.  
```tsx
import { Button, Card, Input, Icon } from 'ascenducore-ui-kit';

function MyComponent() {  
  return (  
    <Card title="Welcome">  
      <p>This is a card from the AscendUCore UI Kit.</p>  
      <Input label="Your Name" leading={<Icon name="fa-solid fa-user" />} />  
      <Button>Submit</Button>  
    </Card>  
  );  
}
```

### **Including Font Awesome CSS (in your main application)**

If you use Font Awesome icons via the name prop of the Icon component, you must include the Font Awesome CSS in your main application's entry point (e.g., public/index.html or your main CSS file).  
```html
<!-- public/index.html in your main application -->  
<head>  
  <!-- ... other head content ... -->  
  <link  
    rel="stylesheet"  
    href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0/css/all.min.css"  
    integrity="sha512-9usAa10IRO0HhonpyAIVpjrylPvoDwiPUiKdWk5t3PyolY1cOd4DSE0Ga+ri4AuTroPR5aQvXU9xC6qOPnzFeg=="  
    crossorigin="anonymous"  
    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"  
  />  
</head>
```

### **Usage in CSS/Sass Applications (via CSS Variables)**

Even if your project primarily uses traditional CSS or Sass for styling, you can benefit from the consistent design tokens. The `_theme.scss` file, generated during the component library's build, contains all design tokens as standard CSS variables (e.g., `--color-background-surface`, `--spacing-md`,).

1. **Import `_theme.scss`:** Copy `_theme.scss` (from node_modules/@activityeducation/component-library/dist/_theme.scss after building your library) into your project and import it into your main Sass or CSS entry point.  
2. **Apply CSS Variables:** Once imported, these variables become globally available and can be used directly in your Sass or CSS rules to apply consistent styling.

## **⚙️ Development Workflow & Contributing**

The AscendUCore Design System employs a streamlined development workflow designed to maximize efficiency, collaboration, and code quality.

### **Storybook: Isolated Development & Documentation**

Storybook is the primary environment for developing, testing, and documenting UI components in isolation. It provides a dedicated sandbox for component work, allowing developers to view and interact with components in various states, adjust props on the fly, and access auto-generated documentation.

* **To start Storybook:**  
  `npm run storybook` or `yarn storybook`

  This will launch Storybook, typically opening it automatically in your web browser at http://localhost:6006.  
* **Build Storybook Static Site:**  
  `npm run build-storybook` or `yarn build-storybook`

  This compiles your Storybook instance into a static web application, typically located in the storybook-static directory, ready for hosting. The Storybook documentation is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages at [design.edupub.social](https://design.edupub.social).

### **Building the Library**

To build the AscendUCore Component Library for distribution, run:  
`npm run build:component``

This script performs:  
1. Cleaning the 'dist' directory.  
2. Compiling TypeScript files to generate .d.ts declaration files (crucial for type-checking).  
3. Bundling JavaScript code into optimized CommonJS (CJS) and ES Modules (ESM) using Rollup.  
4. Minifying bundles with @rollup/plugin-terser to reduce file size.

### **Linting & Type Checking**

To maintain high code quality and consistency:

* **Linting:**  
  `npm run lint` or `yarn lint`

  This executes ESLint to identify code quality issues and enforce coding style guidelines.  
* **Type Checking:** TypeScript type checking is an integral part of the build process, performing comprehensive type validation to catch errors early.

For detailed instructions on how to set up your development environment, adhere to coding standards, and submit your contributions, please refer to our (forthcoming) CONTRIBUTING.md file.

## **Accessibility (A11y)**

Accessibility is a non-negotiable core tenet of the AscendUCore Design System. All components are meticulously developed with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) in mind, utilizing proper semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and ensuring full keyboard navigation support. Automated accessibility checks are integrated into Storybook via the @storybook/addon-a11y to proactively identify and resolve issues.

## **Maintenance & Versioning**

The AscendUCore Design System is a living product, continuously evolving. We utilize semantic-release to automate the entire release workflow, determining the next semantic version, generating changelogs, publishing to npm (e.g., GitHub Packages), creating GitHub releases, and tagging the repository. Our CI/CD pipeline, defined by GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/build-publish-deploy.yml), automates the build, publish, and Storybook deployment processes on every push to the main branch, ensuring stability and rapid delivery.
